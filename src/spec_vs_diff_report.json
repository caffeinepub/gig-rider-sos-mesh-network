  "summary": "REQ-22/23/24 appear implemented: CrashPromptDialog is now globally mounted in the app Layout; useCrashDetection is permission- and setting-gated with a confirmation window and cooldown; Settings store and page wiring show crashThreshold support with a clamped safe range. Some additional Settings/UI behavior was introduced that was not requested (platform limitations copy, cache clear, threshold clamping).",

    {
      "description": "Added a general \"Platform Limitations\" disclaimer block in Settings with multiple bullet points unrelated to crash detection attachment/fix/sensitivity.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest focuses on attaching crash prompt globally, improving crash detection behavior, and adding a crash threshold sensitivity control; it does not request new platform limitation messaging.",

    {
      "description": "Introduced clamping/validation logic for crashThreshold (1.5–5.0) inside the settings store updateSettings path.",
      "reason": "REQ-24 asks for a sensitivity control and a safe default range in the UI, but does not explicitly request enforcing/clamping values at the store layer.",
